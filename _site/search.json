The project builds upon the emg2qwerty framework developed by Meta, which provides a large dataset of sEMG recordings while typing on a QWERTY keyboard. Working from a baseline model we explored various implementations including CNN+GRU and CNN+BiLSTM Hybrid models alongside various preprocessing techniques and transformers.\nRead full project document here\n\n\nCOMAP Competition\nCOMAP, the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, is an award-winning non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing mathematics education, particularly through the promotion of mathematical modeling. This year, my team and I devised a model for a sustainable tourism industry in Juneau, Alaska by balancing visitor numbers, revenue, and tourism stabilization measures using an agent-node representation with weighted edges.

This involved evaluating non-invasive diagnostic methods on 200 Hepatitis B (HBV) patients, utilizing regression and classification models to analyze patient methylation data. Additionally, I explored predictive models for clinical parameters that are essential for liver disease diagnosis and detection.\n\n\nGuo Lab (August 2022 - March 2024)\nI joined the Guo Lab in August 2022 and initiated a secondary analysis on the biomarker and imaging data of over 5000 patients in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database under the guidance of Dr. Zhefeng Guo.\nIn parallel with my computational project, I also conducted wet-lab experiments to investigate the relationship of cerebral spinal fluid on Amyloid Beta protein aggregation.
